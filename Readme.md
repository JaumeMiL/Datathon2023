## Machine learning & AI

In this project we've created some models using time series in ordre to predict how the purchases of clincal and sanitary products evolve in 2023. As we've focused on the temporal components we can easily escalate it in order to predict values not only from 2023 but also from a more widely range of years.

For executing the python interactive notebook it just requires to click on execute everything and all the different plots and informations we've used will just appear.
